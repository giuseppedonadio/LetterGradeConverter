# LetterGradeConverter
Use a class to store grade data.

Operations:

⦁    The user enters a number grade from 0 to 100.

⦁    The application displays the corresponding letter grade.

⦁    The application prompts the user to continue.


Specifications:

⦁    This application uses a class named Grade to store the data for each grade. This class includes these three methods:

        void setNumber(int number)
        
        int getNumber()
        
        String getLetter()
        
⦁    The grading criteria is as follows:

        A    88-100
        
        B    80-87
        
        C    67-79
        
        D    60-67
        
        F    <60
        
⦁    Assume that the user will enter valid integers for the grades.

⦁    The application should continue only if the user enters “y” or “Y” to continue.
